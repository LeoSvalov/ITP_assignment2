# Assignment 2. Introduction to Programming II.
This code is based on the [assignment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KNnYcRBENFOOwE5hAk1z8EFb2LKowIdE/view?usp=sharing) that was given
during the spring semester.

## Idea
The assignment is one of the versions of the [NP-complete task](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82723490.pdf) about making the schedule of studying. That's why the only one algo for the solution for this is a brute force of all(actually, almost all) possible variants of schedule.
